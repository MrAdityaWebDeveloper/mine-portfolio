        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Netflix Clone</h3>
        <p>One of my most exciting projects is creating a Netflix clone using just HTML and CSS. This project allowed me to practice my skills in layout design, responsive web development, and UI/UX principles. I replicated the clean and modern design of Netflix's homepage, including features like the navigation bar, movie banners, and hover effects. The clone is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring that users have a smooth experience whether they’re on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. This project helped me deepen my understanding of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and how to create aesthetically pleasing, functional web pages without relying on JavaScript for interactivity.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Twitter Clone</h3>
        <p>As part of my recent project, I created a fully responsive Twitter clone using Tailwind CSS, which allowed me to explore and implement utility-first CSS principles. This clone features a simple yet functional design that replicates the core elements of the Twitter platform, including the user timeline, tweets, retweets, and notifications. By leveraging Tailwind’s utility classes, I was able to quickly design a clean and modern layout with consistent styling across all components.
          In this project, I also focused on making the interface mobile-friendly, ensuring that users would have a seamless experience on devices of all screen sizes. The timeline design includes scrollable tweet cards, and the navigation bar mimics the simplicity and accessibility of the original Twitter layout. This project enhanced my skills in using modern CSS frameworks and reinforced the importance of responsive web design.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">"How I Built My Portfolio Website"</h2>
      <div class="blog-post">
        <h3>Let's Start</h3>
        <p>Building my portfolio website was both a fun and challenging experience. As a web developer, it’s essential to have a website that showcases my skills and experience, and I wanted mine to stand out with sleek animations and a clean design.

            Here's a breakdown of how I built it:
            
         >  Tech Stack: I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the layout and functionality. For animations, I used CSS keyframes to make the site feel interactive and smooth.
            Responsive Design: I made sure the portfolio was mobile-friendly and adapted seamlessly to different screen sizes.
            Project Showcase: Each of my projects has a dedicated section with a brief description and a link to the live site or GitHub repository.
            Contact Form: I included a simple contact form for potential clients or employers to reach out to me directly.
            It was a fantastic way to put my skills into practice and create something that reflects my style and expertise.
            
        >   Blog Title: "The Rise of JavaScript Frameworks: React vs Vue vs Angular"
            Posted on January 22, 2025
            
        >    As web development continues to evolve, JavaScript frameworks have become a crucial part of my workflow. With so many frameworks available, it can be tough to choose the right one. Here's a comparison of the three most popular ones:
            
            React: Known for its flexibility and vast ecosystem, React is perfect for building dynamic user interfaces and large-scale applications.
            Vue: A progressive framework, Vue is easy to integrate into projects and has a simple, clean API. It's ideal for smaller applications and quick prototyping.
            Angular: Angular is a full-fledged framework that offers everything you need for building complex applications. It has a steeper learning curve but is extremely powerful once you get the hang of it.
            Each framework has its pros and cons, and I choose based on the project requirements. React is my go-to for most projects, but Vue and Angular have their use cases too.</p>

        <h3>"The Importance of Code Quality in Web Development"</h3>
        <p>In web development, clean and maintainable code is essential not only for my own productivity but also for the long-term success of any project. Here's why I prioritize code quality:

            Readability: Code that is easy to read and understand allows for quicker debugging and future updates. I follow consistent naming conventions, indentation, and comments.
            Efficiency: Writing efficient code minimizes load times and ensures optimal performance, which is critical for user experience.
            Testing: Writing tests for my code ensures that it functions as expected and helps prevent bugs in production.
            Collaboration: Clean code makes it easier for other developers to work on the same project, reducing misunderstandings and errors.
            I use tools like ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and ensure that my work is always up to industry standards.
